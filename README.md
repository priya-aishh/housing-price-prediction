House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in the future. House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house based on the features and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house and helps seller in selecting the right selling price of the house. There are so many factors that influence the price of a house which includes House style, Ground living area, Total rooms, Year built, etc. In this dataset there are 81 features from which only important features has been taken as independent variable in feature engineering. First I fitted the linear regression model and to reduce the mean squared error I have applied log transformation in the dependent variable. This research aims to predict house prices based on the features of it with multivariate linear regression and random forest and batch gradient descent for optimization. The result from this research proved that random forest regression algorithm is suitable and get the minimum prediction error obtained and it has given the accuracy of 92.72% which is better than the result of linear regression.
